I never thought I'd be a Web Developer or coder. I graduated with a Sociology degree and went on to get a Masters in Audiology. I practiced Audiology for awhile and then took a break to start a family. My first stint into Web Development ocurred roughly two years ago. I was asked to develop a website for our school store. I had no idea what I was doing. I used WordPress, and somehow created something extremely basic, but usable. I spent hours and hours on the site, and though I was often frustrated, I loved the creation process and was always trying to make it better. The following year, I was hired to work part-time at an events company. My initial job there had nothing to do with computers or code, and wasn't at all technical. After the first few months, I was bored and realized the company could use some help with their processes. I suggested, and then created, a pricing model in excel that would also serve as the base for all outgoing written collateral for each event. I had only dabbled in excel to this point, but I taught myself everything I could and loved it. I quickly realized that while I loved creating these spreasheets, excel had many limitations. I began to write Macros (not very well) and tried to work around my problems. I spent hours and hours trying to make the Macros work and learning as much as I could about coding, excel, and spreadsheet design. I realized that I loved every minute despite the setbacks and frustrations. I was in the midst of taking a few on-line coding courses when someone recommended the Flatiron School. After looking into it, I realized I needed to officially start my Web Development/Coding/Software Engineer Career...and here I am.
